# ahmetelcin-archive

🎓 **A personal archive of my early Discord bot projects and prototypes.**  
These repositories represent my learning journey from basic command handling to modular bot architecture, game logic, and database-backed features.

## 📚 What's Inside?

This archive includes:

   **Legacy Bots (Cleaned)**  
   Older bots originally made during high school.  
   These have been reviewed and sanitized — removing NSFW, real-person references, or overly humorous commands.

## 💡 Why Archive?

As developers, our early projects tell a story.  
This archive shows my evolution from writing simple "fun commands" to designing scalable, feature-rich systems.  
It's here to share, reflect, and show how learning happens — one bot at a time.
